# Album - LittleLives

![Preview](https://i.imgur.com/pgWPOHw.png)

## Overview

An application for album management. You can create a new album with name and cover, and photos into it, and view photos in lightbox with navigation. Album and image are 2 main components of this project. They were designed with their own model, view and controller.

I built this project with Angular CLI framework, enhanced with Bulma CSS. FakerJS is used to generate fake data. It gets images from [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos/), which could be slow sometimes. Please note that data will be different everytime browser refreshes.

This project may not be perfect to satisfy all the requirements. But I have tried all my best to make it as good as possible. Your review will be very valuable to me.

## Prerequisites

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.1. 

You need to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed on your device. 

Then run `npm install -g @angular/cli` from cmd to install Angular CLI.
